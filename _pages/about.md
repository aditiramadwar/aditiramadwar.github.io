Hi, a little bit about myself, I am Aditi who is currently pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics at the University of Maryland. I am a robotics enthusiast with an incline towards path planning and control. I also hold a bachelor's degree in Electronics engineering.

I have worked in the industry as a firmware engineer for two years at a robotic company, [Miko](https://miko.ai/), working on module specific projects which included motion control, sensor integration and factory automation. In my undergrate years, I spent my time working on various projects that helped me learn a lot about the kind of technology currently being used in the industry. 

I am always excited to learn the new types of technologies being developed and used in the industry and how I can use them to develop my own work.

Oh, and also, I am heavily into hiking and playing tennis. Hit me up if you want to talk sports, robotics, automation, or anything fun in life! :)

**Firmware Engineer, [Miko](https://miko.ai/)** 
#### August 2019 - July 2021 | Mumbai, India
----- 
* Automated factory line testing process using RaspberryPi, C++ and python, resulting in a reduction of manpower and acceleration
of the process by dropping all the way down to 25 seconds from roughly 10 minutes per robot.
* Accelerated the robot factory packaging line using an inventory check method for scanning and printing barcode labels for the
package using VBA to achieve higher efficiency and quicker rollouts.
* Developed a fault detection module on STM32 for detecting huge impacts and falls of the robot in real-time as a feature to
determine the cause of failure in case of non-functionality, increased accuracy by 80%, and dependency on module raised to 50%.
* Designed compact and power-efficient PCBs for hardware testing platforms of the robot using Eagle resulting in enhanced
extensive capabilities of quality testing of the functionality of each part in the robot.
